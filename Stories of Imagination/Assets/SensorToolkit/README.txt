Thank you for purchasing SensorToolkit 2!

The documentation is available online at: http://www.micosmo.com/sensortoolkit2
There are some example scenes inside Examples/ directory. I recommend first viewing the 'Fundamentals' scene.

If you have any questions, feature requests or if you have found a bug then please send me an email at micosmogames@gmail.com
